I am basing my decisions soley on the fact that these degrees are the highest/lowest demand and highest/lowest paying.  This is not a reflection of my personal opinion of the value of these careers.  While researching this topic, I found an interesting discrepancy.  Elementary Education has one of the lowest unemployment rates, meaning it is in high demand, yet it is also one of the lowest paying jobs.
